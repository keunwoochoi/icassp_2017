This repo **WILL** contain 
 * split setting (which exists in [this repo](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/MSD_split_for_tagging) already)
 * codes to build the used models in the paper
 * Pre-trained weights of some system

for the paper, [Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Music Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04243). 

Meanwhile, take a look on [my previous music tagger repo](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/music-auto_tagging-keras)
